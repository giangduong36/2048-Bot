# 2048-Bot

This project aims to create an artificial intelligence bot that can conquer 2048 game.

### Installation and Usage

Download the directory and run file GameManager2048.py in an IDE of your choice or in Terminal.

You will be asked to enter the program's mode. 

To begin in the USER mode and play 2048 yourself, enter "User". For each turn, enter "r" to move right, "l" to move left, "d" to move down, "u" to move up and "q" to quit.

To start the AI mode and let the bot solve the puzzle for you, enter "AI" and enjoy!

### Design decisions

This AI program is implemented using Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning. The default depth to search in Minimax Algorithm is 6, which is the most efficient depth for both time efficiency and success rate.
